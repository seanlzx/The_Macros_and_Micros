This tools are the tools I used personally for the project to scrape data from various sources.

Since they were only for personal developmental use, their super unituitive and complicated to use.

I did have plans to make a much easier way to scrape food data, and possibly integrate it with, however since I'll be taking a break from this project indefinitely, and on the off chance anyone desires too, you may use this tools to scrape from the USDA's food database and cronometer.

Do note the the USDA's database requires and API key.
