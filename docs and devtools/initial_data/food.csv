An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are 
cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree 
originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. 
Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North 
America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many 
cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant 
fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by 
clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and 
much slower to fruit after planting. contains antioxidants",0.46,1

The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). 
It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated by Mesoamerican tribes more than 5,000 years ago. 
Then as now it was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely originated 
in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala. Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as 
an alligator or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed. Avocado trees 
are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. 
Avocados are presently cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries. Mexico is 
the world's leading producer of avocados as of 2020, supplying nearly 30% of the global harvest in that year.",1.32,1
