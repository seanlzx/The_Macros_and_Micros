07:36 07/02/2023    about to implement dynamically loaded tabs that can save form data
07:41               renamed debugPurposesOnly to addUpdateValueEvent

15:52 08/02/2023	successfully implemented dynamic tabs
						- hour and minute inputs update appropriately
						- placeholders implicitly named appropriately
						- scripts for various tab windows run appropriately
						- inputs are saved when switching or closing tab
						
16:40 08/02/2023	- categoryList and foodList for inputs with datalist now load with index.html
					- removed categoryList and foodList from loadFormFormData() function, removed 
					references to foodList and dataList to avoid errors, (/addFoodTab had an error
					when I forgot to remove it properly, easy fix)

                    - getFormListValues now assigns an empty string if it can't get the specified form input
                        this is to avoid errors with the dictionary being used afterwards to retrieve a nonexistent 
                        key (especially for infoDict["description"] as description should be optional)
