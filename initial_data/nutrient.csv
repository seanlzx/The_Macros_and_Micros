9,2022/11/06 23:59:59,trans_fats   ,"Trans fatty acids, more commonly called trans fats, are made by heating liquid vegetable oils in the presence of hydrogen gas and a catalyst, a process called hydrogenation.
Partially hydrogenating vegetable oils makes them more stable and less likely to become rancid. This process also converts the oil into a solid, which makes them function as margarine or shortening.
Trans fats are the worst type of fat for the heart, blood vessels, and rest of the body because they:
Raise bad LDL and lower good HDL",1,1,1
10,2022/11/06 23:59:59,omega_3,"These are essential fats the body can't make them from scratch but must get them from food. 
They are an integral part of cell membranes throughout the body and affect the function of the cell receptors in these membranes. They provide the starting point for making hormones that regulate blood clotting, contraction and relaxation of artery walls, and inflammation. 
They also bind to receptors in cells that regulate genetic function. Likely due to these effects, omega-3 fats have been shown to help prevent heart disease and stroke, may help control lupus, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis, and may play protective roles in cancer and other conditions.",1,1,1

39,2022/11/06 23:59:59,creatine ,"Tonic of the gods. 

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an organic compound that provides energy to drive many processes in living cells, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, condensate dissolution, and chemical synthesis. Found in all known forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the ""molecular unit of currency"" of intracellular energy transfer. When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP. The human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day. It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a coenzyme.

Creatine causes you to hold a bit more water INSIDE muscle fiber cells. This is NOT the same as water bloating, outside the muscle fiber. This is cell volumization, inside the cell.

From the perspective of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate.

Can improve brain and bone health
Should avoid taking with caffeine, as the effects of creatine maybe blunted by high doses of caffeine. So take them at different Times",5,1,1
